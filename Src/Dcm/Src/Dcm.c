 *  \brief DCM (Diagnostic Communication Manager).
 *
 *  The DCM processes diagnostic commands sent externally to the ECU (Electronic Control Unit)
 *  via a external interface. The current supported external interface is CAN (Central Area Network).
 *  The DCM has an internal interface towards the DEM and lets it interact with the DEM upon certain
 *  external request for example clearing of the error memory. For further instructions on how the DCM
 *  and works and how to configure it see section XX in the documentation.
 *
 *  TODO: Add reference to DCM section in.
