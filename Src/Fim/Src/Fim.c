 *
 *  \brief FIM (Function Inhibition Manager).
 *
 *  The FIM takes inputs from either the DEM or externally via its interface to calculate
 *  the inhibition matrix and trigger the right FID (Function Identifier). It can be used
 *  to inhibit certain functionalities in the case of an error or other circumstances when
 *  a certain functionality is not desired.
 *
 *  TODO: Add reference to FIM section in.
